Description: The main goal of the psycho package is to provide tools for psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists, 
   to facilitate and speed up the time spent on data analysis. It aims at supporting best practices and tools to format the output 
   of statistical methods to directly paste them into a manuscript, ensuring statistical reporting standardization and conformity.
