  Psycho is an R package that aims at providing tools for psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists, to transform statistical outputs into something readable that can be, almost directly, copied and pasted into a report. It also implements various functions useful in psychological science, such as correlation matrices, assessment plot creation or normalization. The package revolves around the psychobject. Main functions from the package return this type, and the `analyze()` function transforms other R objects into psychobjects. Four functions can then be applied on a psychobject: `summary()`, `print()`, `plot()` and `values()`. Contrary to many other packages which goal is to produce statistical analyzes, `psycho` aims at filling the gap between statistical R outputs and statistical report writing, with a focus on APA formatting guidelines, to enhance the standardization of results reporting. Complex outputs, such as those of Bayesian and frequentist mixed models, are automatically transformed into readable text, tables, and plots that illustrate the effects. Thus, the results can easily be incorporated into shareable reports and publications, promoting data exploration, saving time and preventing errors for better, reproducible, science.

# Overview

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(rstanarm)
```



## Installation

```{r}
# Do this once (uncomment if needed)
# install.packages("devtools") 
# library(devtools)
# devtools::install_github("https://github.com/neuropsychology/psycho.R")

# Load psycho (at the beginning of every script)
library(psycho)
```


## General Workflow


The package mainly revolves around the `psychobject`. Main functions from the package return this type, and the `analyze()` function transforms other R objects into psychobjects. Then, 4 functions can be applied on a psychobject: `summary()`, `print()`, `plot()` and `values()`.

```{r, out.width=700, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/workflow.PNG")
```

# Examples 

## Correlation Table and Plot

It is possible to quickly run a correlation analysis on a dataframe with the flexible and powerful `correlation()` function.

### Basic Correlations
```{r, fig.width=8, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', results='hide'}
library(psycho)

df <- iris

cor <- psycho::correlation(df, 
                           type = "full",
                           method = "pearson",
                           adjust = "none")

summary(cor)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(summary(cor))
```


You can save this correlation matrix using `write.csv(print(cor), "correlation_table.csv")`. That is very useful to *copy/paste* it from excel to a paper or a report :) 

You can also draw a quick visualization:
```{r, fig.width=8, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
plot(cor)
```
 


### Partial, Corrected, Correlations

`correlation()` offers the possibility to run partial or semi-partial 
correleations, as well as printing them pairwise.

```{r, fig.width=8, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', results='markup', comment=NA}
library(psycho)

df <- iris

pcor <- psycho::correlation(df, 
                           type = "partial",
                           method = "pearson",
                           adjust = "bonferroni")

summary(pcor)
```

You can also have access to the individual correlations as follows:

```{r, results='markup', comment=NA}
print(pcor)
```

------

## Standardize / Normalize / Z-score / Scale

The `standardize()` function allows you to easily scale and center all numeric variables of a dataframe. It is similar to the base function `scale()`, but presents some advantages: it is tidyverse-friendly, data-type friendly (*i.e.*, does not transform it into a matrix) and can handle dataframes with categorical data.

```{r, out.width=8, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', results='markup', comment=NA}
library(psycho)
library(tidyverse)

iris %>% 
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length) %>% 
  psycho::standardize() %>% 
  summary()
```


------

## Assess

This function is useful in clinical activity. It is sometimes necessary to show to the patient, his family or other members of staff, a visual representation of his score. The `assess()` function also computes the percentile and the Z-score, often needed for neuropsychological reports.


```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, eval = TRUE, results='markup', fig.align='center', comment=NA}
library(psycho)

results <- psycho::assess(124, mean=100, sd=15)

# Print it
print(results)

# Plot it
plot(results)
```

It is also possible to custom the plot a bit (see the [documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/psycho/versions/0.0.8/topics/assess) for available parameters).

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, eval = TRUE, results='markup', fig.align='center'}
library(psycho)

results <- psycho::assess(85, mean=100, sd=15, linecolor = "orange", fillcolor = "#4CAF50")

# Plot it
plot(results)
```



------

## Custom Plots

In general, the `plot()` function returns, most of the times, a ggplot object. That means it remains quite flexible. Here's an example.


```{r eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4.5, fig.width=9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='markup'}
library(psycho)

# Let's create a correlation plot
p <- plot(psycho::correlation(iris))

# Custom theme and colours
p <- p + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("#4CAF50", "#FFEB3B", "#FF5722")) +
  ylab("Variables\n") +
  labs(fill = "r") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#607D8B"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20, angle = 90, colour="white"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 15, colour="white"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 20, colour="white"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 15, colour="white"),
        title = element_text(size = 16, colour="white"))
p

```



------

## How many factors/components to retain?

The `n_factors()` function is useful in before running principal component (PCA) or factor (FA) analysis. As many statistical methods exists to that purpose, this function gathers them together and gives an overview on the most frequent result. It also draw a nice plot with the eigenvalues and the proportion of explained  variance.


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
results <- attitude %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  psycho::n_factors()

# Get a summary
summary(results)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(summary(results))
```

We can also extract the final result (the optimal number of factors) for each method:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
psycho::values(results)$methods
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(psycho::values(results)$methods)
```

And, of course, plot it :)

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, eval = TRUE, results='markup', fig.align='center'}
plot(results)
```

## Analyze the Mixed-Modelling Framework

This is possibly the most important function of the `psycho` package. Its goal is to transform complex outputs of complex statistical routines into something readable, interpretable, and formatted. It is designed to work with frequentist and Bayesian mixed models, which is the central statistical method for psychological science.

### Data Creation

Let's start by creating a dataframe similar to those found in psychological science.

```{r, results='hide'}
set.seed(666)
df <- data.frame(Participant = as.factor(rep(1:25, each = 4)), 
                 Item = rep_len(c("i1", "i2", "i3", "i4"), 100), 
                 Condition = rep_len(c("A", "B", "A", "B", "B"), 20), 
                 Error = as.factor(sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = T)),
                 RT = rnorm(100, 30, .2), 
                 Stress = runif(100, 3, 5))

# Standardize the numeric variables.
df <- psycho::standardize(df)

# Take a look  at the first 10 rows
head(df)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(head(df))
```

This dataframe contains the data of 25 participants (labelled from 1 to 25). Each saw 4 different items (i1-i4) in two conditions (A and B). We measured, for each item, if the response was correct or not (Error), its reaction time (RT) and the stress associated with the trial.

### Ancient Approach

In order to investigate the effect of the condition on the reaction time RT, the traditional, ancient and obsolete routine is 1) to compute the mean for each participant, and 2) run an ANOVA.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='markup', comment=NA}
# Format data
df_for_anova <- df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Participant, Condition) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(RT = mean(RT))

# Run the anova
anova <- aov(RT ~ Condition + Error(Participant), df_for_anova)
summary(anova)
```

As we can see, the effect of the condition is not significant (unsuprisingly, as data was generated randomly). One of the many flaws of this approach is that we lose information about intra-individual and item-related variability.


### Mixed Linear Regressions (lme4, lmerTest)

The use of the mixed-modelling framework allows us to add the items as random factors.

```{r fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, val=TRUE, results='markup', comment=NA}
library(lme4)

fit <- lme4::lmer(RT ~ Condition + (1|Participant) + (1|Item), data=df)

# Traditional output
summary(fit)
```

As the output is a bit messy, the `analyze()` function will munge this into something nicely formatted.

```{r, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
results <- psycho::analyze(fit)

# We can extract a formatted summary table
summary(results, round = 2)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(summary(results, round = 2))
```


We can also print it in a text format!

```{r, results='markup', comment=NA}
print(results)
```


### Bayesian Mixed Linear Regressions (rstanarm)

However, as the frequentist framework is criticized, it is advised to switch to the Bayesian framework. Unfortunately, interpretation of these models remain unfamiliar to regular psychologists. But stay calm, because `analyze()` handles this for you. 

```{r fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, val=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(rstanarm)

fit <- rstanarm::stan_lmer(RT ~ Condition + (1|Participant) + (1|Item), data=df)

# Traditional output
results <- psycho::analyze(fit, effsize=T)
summary(results, round=2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(summary(results, round = 2))
```

```{r, results='markup', comment=NA}
print(results)
```

We can also plot the effects:
```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, eval = TRUE, results='markup', fig.align='center'}
plot(results)
```

Obviously, you need to learn more about Bayesian analyses before running them. You can find more information in the rstanarm's [vignettes](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rstanarm/vignettes/rstanarm.html).
