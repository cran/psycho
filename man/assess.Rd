\description{
Compare a patient's score to a control group.
}
\details{
Until relatively recently the standard way of testing for a difference between a case and controls was to convert the caseâ€™s score to a z score using the control sample mean and standard deviation (SD). If z was less than -1.645 (i.e., below 95% of the controls) then it was concluded that the case was significantly lower than controls. However, this method has serious disadvantages (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2012).
