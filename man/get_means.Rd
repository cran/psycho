\title{Compute estimated means from models.}
\usage{
get_means(fit, formula = NULL, CI = 90, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A model (lm, lme4 or rstanarm).}

\item{formula}{A character vector (formula like format, i.e., including
interactions or nesting terms) specifying the names of the predictors over which EMMs are desired.}

\item{CI}{Determine the confidence or credible interval bounds.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods. For instance, transform="response".}
}
\value{
Estimated means (or median of means for Bayesian models)
}
\description{
Compute estimated means of factor levels based on a fitted model.
