  Psycho is an R package that aims at providing tools for psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists, to transform statistical outputs into something readable that can be, almost directly, copied and pasted into a report. It also implements various functions useful in psychological science, such as correlation matrices, assessment plot creation or normalization. The package revolves around the psychobject. Main functions from the package return this type, and the analyze() function transforms other R objects (for now, only stan_lmer type) into psychobjects. Four functions can then be applied on a psychobject: summary(), print(), plot() and values(). Contrary to many other packages which goal is to produce statistical analyzes, `psycho`'s goal is to fill the gap between statistical R output and statistical report writing, with a focus on APA formatting guidelines. Complex outputs, such as those of Bayesian linear models, are automatically transformed into readable text, important values are extracted and plots are drawn to illustrate the effects. Thus, the results can easily be incorporated into shareable reports and publications, saving time and preventing errors for better, reproducible, science.

# Overview

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(rstanarm)
```



## Installation

```{r}
# Do this once (uncomment if needed)
# install.packages("devtools") 
# library(devtools)
# devtools::install_github("https://github.com/neuropsychology/psycho.R")

# Load psycho (at the beginning of every script)
library(psycho)
```


## General Workflow


The package mainly revolves around the `psychobject`. Main functions from the package return this type, and the `analyze()` function transforms other R objects into psychobjects. Then, 4 functions can be applied on a psychobject: `summary()`, `print()`, `plot()` and `values()`.

```{r, out.width=700, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/workflow.PNG")
```

# Examples 

## Correlation Table and Plot

It is possible to quickly run a correlation analysis on a dataframe with the flexible and powerful `correlation()` function.

### Basic Correlations
```{r, fig.width=8, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', results='hide'}
library(psycho)

df <- iris

cor <- psycho::correlation(df, 
                           type = "full",
                           method = "pearson",
                           adjust = "none")

print(cor)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(print(cor))
```


You can save this correlation matrix using `write.csv(print(cor), "correlation_table.csv")`. That is very useful to *copy/paste* it from excel to a paper or a report :) 

You can also draw a quick visualization:
```{r, fig.width=8, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
cor$plot()
```
 


### Partial, Corrected, Correlations

`correlation()` offers the possibility to run partial or semi-partial 
correleations.

```{r, fig.width=8, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', results='hide'}
library(psycho)

df <- iris

pcor <- psycho::correlation(df, 
                           type = "partial",
                           method = "pearson",
                           adjust = "bonferroni")

print(pcor)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(print(pcor))
```


------

## Normalize / Z-score / Scale

The `normalize()` function allows you to easily scale and center all numeric variables of a dataframe. It is similar to the base function `scale()`, but presents some advantages: it is tidyverse-friendly, data-type friendly (*i.e.*, does not transform it into a matrix) and can handle dataframes with categorical data.

```{r, out.width=8, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', results='markup'}
library(psycho)
library(tidyverse)

iris %>% 
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length) %>% 
  psycho::normalize() %>% 
  summary()
```

------

## Assess

This function is useful in clinical activity. It is sometimes necessary to show to the patient, his family or other members of staff, a visual representation of his score. The `assess()` function also computes the percentile and the Z-score, often needed for neuropsychological reports.


```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, eval = TRUE, results='markup', fig.align='center'}
library(psycho)

results <- psycho::assess(124, mean=100, sd=15)

# Print it
print(results)

# Plot it
plot(results)
```


------

## Analyze the Mixed-Modelling Framework

This is possibly the most important function of the `psycho` package. Its goal is to transform complex outputs of complex statistical routines into something readable, interpretable, and formatted. It is designed to work with frequentist and Bayesian mixed models, which is the central statistical routine used in psychological science.

### Data Creation

Let's start by creating a dataframe similar to those find in psychological science.

```{r, results='hide'}
set.seed(666)
df <- data.frame(Participant = as.factor(rep(1:25, each = 4)), 
                 Item = rep_len(c("i1", "i2", "i3", "i4"), 100), 
                 Condition = rep_len(c("A", "B", "A", "B", "B"), 20), 
                 Error = as.factor(sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = T)),
                 RT = rnorm(100, 30, .2), 
                 Stress = runif(100, 3, 5))

# Normalize the numeric variables.
df <- psycho::normalize(df)

# Take a look  at the first 10 rows
head(df)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(head(df))
```

This dataframe contains the data of 25 participants (labelled from 1 to 25), that saw 4 items (i1-i4) in two conditions (A and B). We measured, for each item, if the response was correct or not (Error), its reaction time (RT) and the stress associated with the trial.

### Ancient Approach

In order to investigate the effect of the condition on the reaction time RT, the traditional, ancient and obsolete routines are to compute the mean for each participant, and run an ANOVA.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='markup'}
# Format data
df_for_anova <- df %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Participant, Condition) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(RT = mean(RT))

# Run the anova
anova <- aov(RT ~ Condition + Error(Participant), df_for_anova)
summary(anova)
```

As we can see, the effect of condition is not significant (unsuprisingly, as data was generated randomly). One of the many flaws of this approach is that we lose information about intra-individual and item-related variability.


### Mixed Linear Regressions (lme4, lmerTest)

The use of the mixed-modelling framework allows us to add the items as random factors.

```{r fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, val=TRUE, results='markup'}
library(lmerTest)

fit <- lmerTest::lmer(RT ~ Condition + (1|Participant) + (1|Item), data=df)

# Traditional output
summary(fit)
```

As the output is a bit messy, the `analyze()` function will munge this into something nicely formatted.

```{r, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
results <- psycho::analyze(fit)

# We can extract a formatted summary table
summary(results, round = 2)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(summary(results, round = 2))
```


We can also print it in a text format!

```{r, results='markup'}
print(results)
```


### Bayesian Mixed Linear Regressions (rstanarm)

However, as the frequentist framework is criticized, it is advised to switch to a Bayesian framework. However, the interpretation of these models is even more complex and unfamiliar to regular psychologists. But stay calm, because `analyze()` handles this difficulty for you. 

```{r fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, val=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(rstanarm)

fit <- rstanarm::stan_lmer(RT ~ Condition + (1|Participant) + (1|Item), data=df)

# Traditional output
results <- psycho::analyze(fit, Effect_Size=T)
summary(results, round=2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(summary(results, round = 2))
```

```{r, results='markup'}
print(results)
```

We can also plot the effects:
```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, eval = TRUE, results='markup', fig.align='center'}
plot(results)
```

Obviously, you need to learn more about Bayesian analyses before running them. You can find more information in the rstanarm's [vignettes](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rstanarm/vignettes/rstanarm.html).
