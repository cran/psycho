#' Overlap of Two Empirical Distributions.
#'
#' A method to calculate the overlap coefficient of two kernel density estimates (a measure of similarity between two samples).
#'
#' @param x A vector of values from a probability distribution (e.g., posterior probabilities from MCMC sampling).
#' @param y Scalar between 0 and 1, indicating the mass within the credible interval that is to be estimated.
#' @param method Method of AUC computation. Can be "trapezoid" (default), "step" or "spline".
